/**
 * @shortdesc Provides help information for yt-dlx using async/await instead of events.
 *
 * @description This function outputs a thank you message to the console and returns a Promise that resolves with the URL to the official yt-dlx documentation website. It serves as a simple way for users to find where to get help and more information about the library.
 *
 * The function does not require any input parameters.
 *
 * It returns a Promise that resolves with the help documentation URL string upon successful execution, or rejects with an error.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<string>} A Promise that resolves with the help documentation URL.
 * @throws {Error} Throws a formatted error if an unexpected error occurs during execution.
 *
 * @example
 * // 1. Get help information and the documentation URL using async/await with try...catch
 * try {
 * const helpUrl = await YouTubeDLX.Misc.System.Help();
 * console.log("Help URL:", helpUrl);
 * } catch (error) {
 * console.error("An error occurred while trying to get help:", error);
 * }
 * // Note: This function also prints information directly to the console.
 *
 * @example
 * // 2. Basic call without explicit error handling (errors will propagate)
 * // await YouTubeDLX.Misc.System.Help().then(helpUrl => console.log("Help URL:", helpUrl));
 *
 * // Note: Original examples using .on(...) are replaced by standard Promise handling (.then/.catch or await with try/catch).
