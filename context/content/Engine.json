        "description": "Learn how to program with TypeScript in this full course for beginners. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript provides better error checking than JavaScript. This is because TypeScript uses a static type system, which means that the type of a variable is checked before the code is executed.\n\nüíª GitHub Repo: https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary/typescript-youtube-22\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Hitesh Choudhary created this course.
