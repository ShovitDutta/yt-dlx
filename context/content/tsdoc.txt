"Generate a TS-DOC documentation block for the provided TypeScript function.

**Requirements for the TS-DOC block:**

1.  **Standard Structure:** Follow the standard TS-DOC format including:
    * `@shortdesc`: A concise, one-line summary of the function's main purpose.
    * `@description`: A detailed explanation of what the function does, its process, internal dependencies (if applicable), and any specific behaviors (e.g., how sorting works, what kind of inputs it expects/handles).
    * `@param`: For each parameter, describe its purpose, type, whether it's optional/required, and default values.
    * `@returns`: Describe the return type and what it represents under successful conditions.
    * `@throws`: List all specific `Error` types or conditions that can lead to the function throwing an error. Explain the cause of each error.
    * `@example`: Provide **only valid and functional examples** demonstrating the successful usage of the function.
        * Include diverse examples that cover different use cases and optional parameters (e.g., basic usage, verbose logging, specific sorting/filtering options, different output types like stream vs. file).
        * **Crucially, do NOT include any examples that are designed to trigger errors (e.g., invalid input, incompatible options, missing dependencies, or simulated failures).**
        * Ensure placeholder values for sensitive information (like API keys, cookies) are clearly marked (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_YOUTUBE_COOKIES_STRING`).

2.  **Accuracy:** The documentation must accurately reflect the *actual implementation* of the provided TypeScript code, including any specific logic (e.g., how sorting is truly implemented, even if it's based on string comparison rather than strict chronology).

3.  **Clarity & Readability:** Use clear, concise language. Format the TS-DOC in a way that is easy to read and understand.

4.  **No LaTeX for Prose:** Do NOT use LaTeX formatting for regular prose (e.g., descriptions, parameter explanations). Only use it for mathematical or scientific notations if explicitly required, enclosed within `$` or `$$` delimiters.

**Function Code to Document:**
