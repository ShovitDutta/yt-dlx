THERE IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH MY CURRENT ENGINE.TS CODE. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND YOU FIRST HAVE TO LEARN HOW THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS WORKING. SO FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
- LEARN ENTIRE PROJECT STRUCTURE
- READ ENTIRE Engine.json and YtProbe.json 

YOU WILL SEE THAT THE DATA THAT WE ARE GETTING FROM ENGINE.JSON IS NOT CORRECT. YOU NEED TO MAKE THE DATA PROPERLY PARSED AND STRUCTURED. 

BASICALLY THE YtProbe.json is the direct data from yt-dlx.exe and Engine.json is what we get from Engine.ts using Extract.ts
